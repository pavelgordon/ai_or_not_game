A game where user can detect if given text is ai generated or not.
Has increasing levels of difficulty.
UI would look like a card with a text and swippable action (or buttons) to allow user to swipe left or right depending on if they think the text is ai generated or not. Then, user would be shown the answer, if the text is ai generated and proceed to next level with more difficult text. if user failed to recognize correctly.

Suggest UI options that would allow to do so - should look nice and make it fun and simple for users to understand the game and play it.
Suggest some ideas to make the users:
1. become interested about the game and try it out
2. to keep playing the game and be engaged in daily basis, like wordle.
suggest whcih text size, and content would be interesting, e.g. wikipedia data or some articles? boring will be killing the game




Creating a game where users identify AI-generated text can be an engaging and fun experience! Here's a detailed plan for the UI and ideas to spark user interest and sustain daily engagement:

UI Suggestions
Card-based Interface:

Swiping Actions: Each card has a piece of text. Users swipe left for AI-generated and right for human-written (or vice versa). Alternatively, provide “AI” and “Human” buttons.
Show feedback (e.g., “Correct!” or “Oops, this was AI-generated”) immediately after each swipe.
Cards should have smooth animations for swiping, with color-coded results (e.g., green for correct and red for wrong).
Progression Visuals:

Use a progress bar or level indicator to show difficulty progression.
Add fun graphics/icons (like a brain vs. robot) to signify success or failure.
Minimalist Design:

Text should be clean and legible with a neutral background.
Use readable fonts like Roboto or San Francisco, with text size optimized for mobile (16–20px for body text).
Highlight any difficult or surprising parts of the text after the user’s guess.
Hints and Challenges:

Include a “Hint” button that reveals small clues about the text style.
Show a difficulty meter on the screen (e.g., "Easy," "Medium," "Hard").
Content Suggestions
Text Sources:

Use diverse sources to keep content fresh and interesting:
Wikipedia articles: Common knowledge topics, but keep them engaging and short.
News snippets: Real vs. AI-generated news blurbs.
Social media posts: Simulate tweets, Reddit posts, or captions.
Poetry and creative writing: Challenge users with literary or creative samples.
Product reviews: Real customer reviews vs. AI-written.
Avoid long or boring texts. Aim for 50–150 words per card.
Difficulty Progression:

Start with obvious examples like clunky AI phrasing or classic GPT-3 outputs.
Progress to subtle differences like conversational tones or advanced AI-generated outputs.
Incorporate trick questions where both texts are very similar.
To Attract Users
Catchy Branding:

Give the game a fun name like "Human or Bot?", "Text Duel", or "Bot Buster".
Use quirky and relatable taglines like: “Can you outsmart AI?” or “Prove you’re smarter than a robot!”.
Interactive Tutorial:

Show an engaging intro sequence explaining the game in less than 30 seconds.
Make it playful with animations like a robot trying to "hide" behind a human.
Social Sharing:

Encourage users to share their scores or streaks on social media, akin to Wordle.
Show users how they rank globally or among friends.
To Keep Users Engaged Daily
Daily Challenges:

Introduce a daily AI vs. human battle: Present 5-7 curated texts each day.
Reward users with streak badges or unlockables for consecutive playdays.
Leaderboards:

Include global and friend-based leaderboards to boost competitiveness.
Rewards and Levels:

Add a leveling system with titles like “AI Rookie” -> “Bot Whisperer” -> “AI Mastermind.”
Reward users with virtual coins or badges for identifying tricky texts correctly.
Evolving Content:

Tie themes to trending topics (e.g., a theme about recent events, movies, or memes).
Include seasonal challenges (e.g., spooky AI for Halloween, holiday greetings in December).
Challenges Against Friends:

Add a “Versus” mode where users guess texts faster than their friends.
Introduce a team mode: “Team AI vs. Team Human.”
Execution Notes
Gamify Failure: When users get a wrong answer, show fun facts or explanations about how AI works or why the text was tricky.
Dynamic Texts: Incorporate generative AI like GPT-4 to create new content daily, ensuring texts stay fresh and varied.
Dark Mode: Include a dark mode option for better user experience.
This approach combines an intuitive design, engaging content, and gamification to attract and retain users!
